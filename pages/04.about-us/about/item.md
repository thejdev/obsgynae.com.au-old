About the site, the us, and the vision for the site.

===

As a medical student I loved versatility and variation in my resources. I especially loved listening to the handful of good quality, educational podcasts that are available in some fields. These could be played through headphones on the bus on the way to university or student placement and made a great addition to self-directed study.

I especially loved podcasts put out by the Stollery Children’s Hospital in Canada – who release the excellent “PedsCases” podcast – if you haven’t got into that yet… I recommend it and they are up to 100 podcasts which is quite the achievement. I like that to maintain the integrity of the podcasts it’s important to have “expert witnesses” in the form of consultants in their field.

I also think that the folks behind the FOAMed movement deserve a pat on the back. The hippocratic oath states……
> ἡγήσεσθαι μὲν τὸν διδάξαντά με τὴν τέχνην ταύτην ἴσα γενέτῃσιν ἐμοῖς, καὶ βίου κοινώσεσθαι, καὶ χρεῶν χρηΐζοντι μετάδοσιν ποιήσεσθαι, καὶ γένος τὸ ἐξ αὐτοῦ ἀδελφοῖς ἴσον ἐπικρινεῖν ἄρρεσι, καὶ διδάξειν τὴν τέχνην ταύτην, ἢν χρηΐζωσι μανθάνειν, ἄνευ μισθοῦ καὶ συγγραφῆς, παραγγελίης τε καὶ ἀκροήσιος καὶ τῆς λοίπης ἁπάσης μαθήσιος μετάδοσιν ποιήσεσθαι υἱοῖς τε ἐμοῖς καὶ τοῖς τοῦ ἐμὲ διδάξαντος, καὶ μαθητῇσι συγγεγραμμένοις τε καὶ ὡρκισμένοις νόμῳ ἰητρικῷ, ἄλλῳ δὲ οὐδενί.

For those of you who have let your ancient Greek slip a little like I have…..

> “….and to teach them this art, if they want to learn it, without fee or indenture; to impart precept, oral instruction, and all other instruction to my own sons, the sons of my teacher, and to indentured pupils who have taken the physician’s oath…”

I like to think that this can be a platform where ownership can be adopted by others to help turn this into a reliable and easy-to-use resource for use as a self-learning tool and also as a tool that can be referenced “at the coal-face”.

Who are we targeting…
* Medical student in your final rotations?
* Resident who has done a couple of years and wants to brush up?
* A midwife or midwifery student who is seeking more information
* A general practitioner who is after a bit of freshening up on some O+G topics
* A psychiatrist wannabe who inadvertently ended up with a 10 week rotation in O+G and just found out that the psychiatry director is married to an obstetrician … who is your new boss!!?
* Orthopaedic surgeon who never seems to get the IDC in the right spot on your female patients?

…we got you covered!

Our committment to you:
* as of the time of release we will ensure that all relevant Australian guidelines and definitions have been considered
* all podcasts will have input and full review by a consultant Obstetrician & Gynaecologist
* all podcasts will attempt to adhere to Australian Medical School Curriculum – (no serum rhubarbs here!) – and will not go into unreasonable detail …

What we’d love to hear from you…
* ideas for future podcasts (I have a list!)
* resources that you have felt are worthwhile – especially good articles or guidelines
* feedback on the podcasts – particularly if you have some technical expertise tips

What we ARE trying to be…
* A website that can be referenced quickly for at-the-coal-face resources that can be accessed quickly to help in ensuring patients get best care (yes we are shamelessly copying the legends who created Life in the Fast Lane – but as they say imitation is the highest form of flattery)
* A succinct summary of key ideas and presentations that will occur with some regularity in the practice of junior hospital doctors or in general practice
* A pioneer in the FOAMEd movement in women’s health
* A reliable and responsible provider of good information that can guide good care
* A podcast that is succinct, reliable and to-the-point and covers an appropriate depth of material without going too in depth

What we are NOT trying to be…
* a “latest and greatest” podcast to transmit specialist level knowledge – there are people doing this already but you will not find extensive coverage of controversial topics in women’s health on obsgynae.com.au (though we maintain an interest in this area!)
* a substitute for wide reading, good study and keeping up to date 🙂

Special Thanks
* Our contributors – click the tab to learn more about them
* Audacity who provide a great free resource for podcasting
* Incompetech who provide the catchy tunes on The ObsGynaePod

Enjoy our site.

Best regards,
Dr Isaac Hanley & Jaidev Vasudevan
